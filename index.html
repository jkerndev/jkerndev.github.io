    <h1>AI influence in personally identifiable information (PII) disclosure</h1>
    <p>
        After taking the survey at the Fidel Center at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT), you were
        handed a debriefing form containing the URL to this page. Welcome! This page is intended to provide you with more information.
    </p>
    <h2>What Was the Purpose of This Experiment?</h2>
<p>
    The purpose of this experiment was to investigate how the use of artificial intelligence (AI) influences individuals' willingness to disclose personally identifiable information (PII). Specifically, we examined whether participants were more or less likely to disclose sensitive information when interacting with an AI chatbot versus a traditional, static web form.
</p>
<p>
    Participants completed a survey in one of two conditions: one group interacted with static, predetermined questions and responses, while another group interacted dynamically with an AI-driven chatbot. The questions began with less sensitive information (e.g., age, sex, time spent online) and gradually moved toward more sensitive information (e.g., phone number, social security number). The aim was to understand if dynamic AI interaction would influence the extent to which participants shared sensitive information.
</p>

<h2>Were Any Personal Data Stored or At Risk?</h2>
<p>
    No personal or sensitive data provided by you during the experiment was stored, shared, or exposed. <strong>No identifiable personal information (PII) was collected or retained at any point during the study.</strong> 
</p>
<p>
    The only information stored from each participant was entirely anonymous and included:
    <ul>
        <li>Which questions participants answered and which they skipped (without storing any provided answers).</li>
        <li>Participants' major or degree program (e.g., Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering).</li>
    </ul>
    This anonymized information will be stored securely for a maximum of two years from today's date {DATE} and then permanently destroyed.
</p>

<h2>What If I Have More Questions?</h2>
